# Introduction
Pluto is a bright red all terrain vehicle, produced by iRobot in the early 2000s. While the chassis and lower level electronics remain much the same, a lot has been replaced or added to this robot. This manual aims to make it easier for future users to figure out the capabilities of Pluto, and to make use of it in their project.

# Hardware
